These classes mimic the interface of BlockingQueue, they work with primitive rather than Objects so are unable to actually implement the BlockingQueue. They take advantage of the Unsafe.putOrdered&lt;X&gt;, which allows the creation of non-blocking code with guaranteed writes. These writes will not be re-orderd by instruction reordering. Under the covers they use a faster store-store barrier, rather than the the slower store-load barrier, which is used when doing a volatile write. One of the trade off with this improved performance is we are limited to a single producer, single consumer.
